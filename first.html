      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>HiBiZ recently unveiled an AI-driven application designed to answer natural language queries and deliver both visual and conversational insights tailored for manufacturing environments.</p>
      <p>This cutting-edge solution leverages advanced natural language processing to interpret complex operational data, enabling quick decision-making on the factory floor. With an intuitive interface, users can gain immediate clarity on production status, maintenance needs, and quality metrics without navigating multiple software modules.</p>

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>Natural language question answering</li>
        <li>Interactive data visualizations</li>
        <li>Conversational dashboard summaries</li>
        <li>Seamless integration with ERP systems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additional capabilities include customizable alert configurations, historical trend analysis, and multi-language support for global operations.</p>

      <h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
      <p>The application consists of three core layers:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-6">
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React with Tailwind CSS for responsive UI and D3.js for dynamic charts.</li>
        <li><strong>API Layer:</strong> Node.js and Express providing REST endpoints and authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Service:</strong> Python Flask microservice hosting a transformer-based NLP model for query processing.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The AI service communicates asynchronously with the API layer using RabbitMQ, allowing horizontal scaling under heavy query loads. Data persistence is handled by MongoDB, storing both raw and aggregated production metrics.</p>

      <h2>Use Case in Manufacturing</h2>
      <p>Operators can now:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Ask plain-English questions about production metrics.</li>
        <li>Receive real-time visual dashboards on shop-floor performance.</li>
        <li>Get conversational summaries highlighting anomalies and recommendations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Early adopters have reported a 30% reduction in time spent searching for data and a significant improvement in response times for critical maintenance alerts.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, HiBiZ plans to expand the AI application with predictive analytics, using machine learning models trained on historical performance data to forecast equipment failures and optimize production schedules.</p>
